 Overview: 
 // This code controls a robot using an Arduino, L293D motor shield, servo motor, and Ultra sonic   sensors. 
 // Motor Connection: 
                     .Be careful while connecting motors to the L293D motor shield to avoid issues. 
                     .If a motor is connected to the wrong slot (e.g., Motor 4 to M3 but declared as M4 in the code), it will not 
                      move.
// Power Supply: 
// - Use an external power supply above 7 volts to run the motors for optimal performance.
// - Motors will not function properly on the Arduino's 5V supply.
 // Motor Testing:
                 // - Always test individual motors to verify their directions before integrating them into your robot. // // 
                 Troubleshooting:
                 // - If the IR sensors detect obstacles but the wheels do not move, check the motor connections and the code. // // Importance for Beginners: // These steps are crucial, as beginners often overlook them and get stuck at these
